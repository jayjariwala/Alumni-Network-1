# Alumni-Network

The Alumni Network is useful to college as well as students. In this system, alumnus can get
connected with college even after their education. The system will maintain all the formal
information of students which will be further used for notifying alumnus about college events (i.e.,
functions, college news etc.). The users can search student by certain criteria like batches,
department, year etc. Alumnus can make document request such as transcript and other
certificates to the college as per their need (like for employment, further education or emigration
purposes). The system will also be helpful to existing students. They can discuss about their ideas,
technical issues, doubts with other members. Students can also look for details of higher education
in a specific institute using search criteria to get detail information about alumnus. The system is
helpful for posting events. It is possible for college to inform about news and upcoming events.
The members can upload photos in photo gallery. The system also includes service of personal
messages so private interaction between two members is possible.
